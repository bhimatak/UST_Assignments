# C++ Problems on Operators, Conditions, and Loops  
(without Arrays and Strings)

---

### [Operators Section 🔧]

---

### 1. **Calculate Compound Interest**
> Given principal `P`, rate `R`, and time `T`, find Compound Interest.  
Formula: `A = P * (1 + R/100)^T`, CI = A - P  
Use only basic operators.

---

### 2. **Swap Two Numbers Using XOR Operator**
> Swap two integers without a third variable using only the XOR (`^`) operator.

---

### 3. **Check if a Number is Divisible by Both 3 and 5**
> Take an integer and check if divisible by 3 **and** 5 using logical operators (`&&`).

---

### 4. **Check if Two Numbers are Equal Using Only Bitwise XOR**
> Without using `==`, check if two numbers are equal.  
Hint: If `(a ^ b) == 0`, they are equal.

---

### 5. **Find Remainder Without Using `%` Operator**
> Given two integers `a` and `b`, find `a%b` without using `%`.  
Hint: Use `a - (a/b)*b`.

---

---

### [Conditional Statements Section 🔎]

---

### 6. **Check if a Character is an Uppercase Letter**
> Take a character input and check if it is between `'A'` and `'Z'`.

---

### 7. **Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**
> Take three integers and print the largest using nested `if-else`.

---

### 8. **Categorize Temperature into Hot, Warm, Cold**
> Input temperature:
- > 35 → Hot  
- 20–35 → Warm  
- <20 → Cold

Use `if-else` ladder.

---

### 9. **Calculator Using Switch-Case**
> Input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
Use `switch` to perform the operation.

---

### 10. **Check Voting Eligibility**
> Input age. If >= 18, print "Eligible"; else, "Not Eligible".

---

---

### [Loops Section 🔁]

---

### 11. **Print All Odd Numbers from 1 to N**
> Given `N`, print all odd numbers up to `N` using a loop.

---

### 12. **Find Sum of Digits of a Number**
> Input a number and find sum of its digits using a `while` loop.

---

### 13. **Reverse a Number**
> Input a number and print its reverse using loops.  
Example: `123 → 321`

---

### 14. **Print Multiplication Table of a Number**
> Input a number `n`. Print its multiplication table up to 10.

---

### 15. **Count Number of Even and Odd Digits in a Number**
> Input a number, count how many digits are even and how many are odd.

---

### 16. **Find Factorial of a Number**
> Input a number and calculate its factorial using a loop.

---

### 17. **Check if a Number is a Palindrome**
> Input a number.  
A palindrome number reads same backward and forward (e.g., `121`, `545`).  
Check using loops.

---

### 18. **Print the Sum of Even Numbers from 1 to N**
> Given `N`, find the sum of all even numbers between `1` and `N`.

---

### 19. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**
> Input two numbers and find their GCD using Euclid’s method (subtraction-based).

---

### 20. **Print Fibonacci Sequence up to N Terms**
> Print first `N` terms of the Fibonacci series:  
`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …`
