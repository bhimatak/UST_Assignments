# ðŸŽ¯ Important:
Each of these:

- **Feels like a short story** âœ…
- **Needs logic extraction** âœ…
- **Needs pure operators, loops, conditions** âœ…
- **No arrays, no strings** âœ…

# âœ¨ Example to Understand:

**Problem 1 â€” "Lost Treasure Map"**  
- You are *given a number*.  
- Find *smallest digit*.  
- You realize:  
  - Need to **peel digits** one by one (`n % 10`)  
  - Keep track of **smallest** using comparison.  
  - Use **while loop** to go through all digits.

**So you THINK first**, then **program!**
