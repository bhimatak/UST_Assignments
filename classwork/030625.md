## üß© Problem 1: Sensor Calibration (Using `std::array`)

**Objective:**
You are given fixed-size temperature readings from 3 different sensors. Each reading needs to be calibrated using a fixed calibration factor and then averaged per sensor.

**Requirements:**

* Use `std::array<std::array<float, 5>, 3>` to store 3 sensors, each with 5 readings.
* Apply a calibration factor to each sensor:

  * Sensor 1: +0.5
  * Sensor 2: -0.3
  * Sensor 3: +1.2
* Compute and display the average calibrated reading for each sensor.

**Challenge Level:** Intermediate
**Focus Areas:** Nested `std::array`, range-based loops, type safety.

## üß© Problem 2: Scoreboard Manager (Using `std::vector`)

**Objective:**
Design a scoreboard system that reads scores from users (unbounded in size) and maintains:

* Top 3 highest scores.
* Sorted score list (descending).

**Requirements:**

* Use `std::vector<int>` for storing scores.
* Continuously accept input until `-1` is entered.
* Sort scores in descending order.
* Extract and display the top 3 scores.

**Bonus:** Remove duplicate scores before sorting.

**Challenge Level:** Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced
**Focus Areas:** Sorting, input handling, use of `vector::erase`, `std::unique`, and iterators.

## üß© Problem 3: Task Reordering System (Using `std::list`)

**Objective:**
Implement a task manager where tasks can be:

* Added to the end.
* Promoted to the front if marked ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù.
* Removed by name.

**Requirements:**

* Use `std::list<std::string>`.
* Support the following commands:

  * `add <task>` ‚Äì adds a task to the end.
  * `urgent <task>` ‚Äì adds a task to the front.
  * `remove <task>` ‚Äì removes a task by name.
  * `show` ‚Äì displays the current task list.

**Bonus:** Implement a priority system that automatically promotes tasks containing the word "critical".

**Challenge Level:** Advanced
**Focus Areas:** List traversal, `insert`, `erase`, `find`, and command parsing.

## üß© Problem 4: Sliding Window Logging System (Using `std::forward_list`)

**Objective:**
Maintain the **latest N log entries** in a lightweight memory-efficient system. When new logs exceed the size N, remove the oldest (i.e., tail node).

**Requirements:**

* Use `std::forward_list<std::string>`.
* Support log insertion at the front.
* Keep a maximum of **N logs** in the list.
* Display logs in the order **most recent to oldest**.

**Challenge:** Since `forward_list` doesn't support size tracking, implement custom logic to keep count and remove the last node when limit is exceeded.

**Challenge Level:** Advanced
**Focus Areas:** Pointer manipulation, iterator chaining, singly-linked list handling.

---

## üß© Problem 5: Undo/Redo Browser Simulator (Using `std::deque`)

**Objective:**
Simulate a mini-browser with the following operations:

* `visit <url>`: visit a new page.
* `back`: go back to the previous page.
* `forward`: go to the next page.
* `current`: show the current page.

**Requirements:**

* Use two `std::deque<std::string>`:

  * One for back history.
  * One for forward history.
* Handle edge cases (e.g., no back/forward possible).
* Clear forward history if a new page is visited after going back.

**Bonus:** Support `history` command to list full browsing history.

**Challenge Level:** Advanced
**Focus Areas:** `deque` operations at both ends, command parsing, state management.

## ‚úÖ **Problem 1: Sensor Calibration (`std::array`)**

### Test Case:

**Input:**

```cpp
std::array<std::array<float, 5>, 3> sensor_readings = {
    std::array<float, 5>{20.0, 21.0, 22.0, 20.5, 19.8},  // Sensor 1
    std::array<float, 5>{30.0, 30.2, 29.8, 30.1, 30.3},  // Sensor 2
    std::array<float, 5>{25.0, 26.0, 24.0, 25.5, 26.2}   // Sensor 3
};
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Sensor 1 Average (calibrated): 21.16
Sensor 2 Average (calibrated): 29.88
Sensor 3 Average (calibrated): 26.18
```

## ‚úÖ **Problem 2: Scoreboard Manager (`std::vector`)**

### Test Case:

**Input:**

```plaintext
45
70
55
70
90
-1
```

**Expected Output:**

```
All Scores (Sorted): 90 70 70 55 45
Top 3 Scores: 90 70 70
Unique Scores (Sorted): 90 70 55 45
```

## ‚úÖ **Problem 3: Task Reordering System (`std::list`)**

### Test Case:

**Input Sequence:**

```plaintext
add PrepareReport
add SubmitExpense
urgent ClientCall
add FixBug
remove SubmitExpense
show
```

**Expected Output:**

```
ClientCall -> PrepareReport -> FixBug
```

**Bonus Case Input:**

```plaintext
add criticalDeployment
show
```

**Expected Bonus Output (if "critical" triggers urgent insertion):**

```
criticalDeployment -> ClientCall -> PrepareReport -> FixBug
```

## ‚úÖ **Problem 4: Sliding Window Logger (`std::forward_list`)**

**Log Window Size (N):** `3`

### Test Case:

**Input (log messages):**

```plaintext
LogA
LogB
LogC
LogD
LogE
```

**Expected Output (most recent to oldest):**

```
LogE
LogD
LogC
```

**Explanation:**
Older logs (`LogA`, `LogB`) are pushed out as only 3 logs can be stored.
