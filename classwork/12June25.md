#  Problem Statement: CPU Load Balancer Simulation

##  Problem Description

In a high-performance computing cluster, a workload scheduler is responsible for distributing tasks across multiple CPU cores. Each task is uniquely identified and has an associated "load" â€” an estimate of how long it will occupy a CPU. The tasks are defined in a configuration file, along with the number of CPUs available to process them.

You are required to simulate how a multi-core system would assign and execute these tasks concurrently.

### Real-World Analogy:

Imagine a system administrator feeding a list of jobs into a computing cluster. Each job takes a certain amount of processing time, and the CPUs pick them up one by one as they become available. Once a CPU finishes its current task, it should automatically take the next pending one.

##  Input Format

The tasks and CPU count are provided in an input file named `input.txt`, with the following structure:

* The first line indicates the number of CPUs available for processing:

  ```
  CPUs: <number>
  ```

* Each subsequent line contains a task in the format:

  ```
  <TaskID>: Load <N>
  ```

###  Example `input.txt`:

```
CPUs: 3
T1: Load 3
T2: Load 5
T3: Load 2
T4: Load 4
T5: Load 1
```

---

##  Expected Output Behavior

Your program should simulate the CPUs picking and completing tasks. Each CPU can execute only one task at a time, but all CPUs operate in parallel. The output should indicate:

* Which CPU picked which task
* When the CPU finishes that task

Each task's simulated load should be treated as seconds of processing time (use sleep/delay). The order of task assignment may vary across executions due to thread scheduling.

###  Sample Output:

```
CPU-1 picked Task T1 (Load: 3)
CPU-2 picked Task T2 (Load: 5)
CPU-3 picked Task T3 (Load: 2)
CPU-3 finished Task T3
CPU-3 picked Task T4 (Load: 4)
CPU-1 finished Task T1
CPU-1 picked Task T5 (Load: 1)
CPU-1 finished Task T5
CPU-3 finished Task T4
CPU-2 finished Task T2
All tasks completed.
```

##  Requirements

* Read all tasks and CPU count from `input.txt`.
* Implement parallel execution using multithreading.
* Ensure that:

  * No task is processed by more than one CPU.
  * No task is skipped.
  * Tasks are executed to completion.
* Ensure that shared resources (like the task queue) are accessed safely without race conditions.

---

##  Do Not

* Do not hardcode the number of CPUs or tasks.
* Do not use any global variables unless protected against concurrent access.
