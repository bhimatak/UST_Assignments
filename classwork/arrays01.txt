Q1.
Problem Statement:
Given an unsorted array a of size N of non-negative integers, 
find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number sum.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains integers denoting the elements 
of the array.
The last line contains an integer, denoting the sum. 

Constraints
1<= n<=100
1<=arr<= 1000, where arr is the ith element of the array.
1<= n<=100000

Output Format:
The output line contains integers denoting the indexes.

TESTCASE 1:
Input:
7
[1, 4, 0, 0, 3, 10, 5]

sum = 7
Output: 
Sum found between indexes 1 and 4

TESTCASE 2:
Input:
2
[1, 4]
sum = 0
Output: 
No subarray found

Q.2
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position 
where equilibrium first occurs in the array. Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of   elements after it.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains integers denoting the elements 
of the array.
Constraints
1<= n<=100
1<=arr<= 1000, where arr is the ith element of the array.

Output Format:
The output line contains integer denoting an equilibrium
index (if any) or -1 (if no equilibrium indexes exist).

TESTCASE 1:
Input:
7
[-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]

o/p
3

I/p
5
[0 0 0 0 -1]

o/p
4

Q3. Given an array of positive integers. 
Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
And the rightmost element is always a leader.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains integers denoting the elements of the array.
 
Constraints
 1<= n<=100-1000<=arr[i]<= 1000, where arr is the ith  element of the array.
 Output Format:
 The output line prints all the leaders in the array.
 
TESTCASE 1:
 Input:
 6
 6 7 4 3 5 2
 Output: 
 2 5 7
 
TESTCASE 2:
 Input:
 5
 2 6 3 8 4 
 Output:
 4 8
