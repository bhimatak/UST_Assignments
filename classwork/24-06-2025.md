###  Problem Statement: **Reorganize a Linked List Based on Position Parity**

#### Objective:

Given a singly linked list, reorganize the list such that all nodes at **odd positions** appear first, followed by nodes at **even positions**. Maintain the **original relative order** of nodes in each group (odd and even).

---

####  Description:

You are given a singly linked list where the position of the nodes starts from `1`. Your task is to rearrange the list in such a way that:

* All nodes positioned at **odd indices** appear first.
* Then follow all the nodes at **even indices**.
* You must do this in-place without using any extra list or array.

---

####  Input:

* A linked list with `n` nodes.
* Node values are integers.

---

####  Output:

* The reordered linked list with odd-positioned nodes followed by even-positioned nodes.

---

####  Example:

**Input Linked List:**

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
```

**Output Linked List:**

```
1 → 3 → 5 → 2 → 4
```

---

####  Constraints:

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
* The list should be modified in-place (no new list creation allowed).
* Do not change the value of nodes, only the pointers.

---

####  Hints:

* Use two pointers, one for odd and one for even positions.
* Maintain the head of the even list to append at the end of the odd list.
