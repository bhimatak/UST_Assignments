###  Problem Statement: **Reorganize a Linked List Based on Position Parity**

#### Objective:

Given a singly linked list, reorganize the list such that all nodes at **odd positions** appear first, followed by nodes at **even positions**. Maintain the **original relative order** of nodes in each group (odd and even).

---

####  Description:

You are given a singly linked list where the position of the nodes starts from `1`. Your task is to rearrange the list in such a way that:

* All nodes positioned at **odd indices** appear first.
* Then follow all the nodes at **even indices**.
* You must do this in-place without using any extra list or array.

---

####  Input:

* A linked list with `n` nodes.
* Node values are integers.

---

####  Output:

* The reordered linked list with odd-positioned nodes followed by even-positioned nodes.

---

####  Example:

**Input Linked List:**

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
```

**Output Linked List:**

```
1 → 3 → 5 → 2 → 4
```

---

####  Constraints:

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
* The list should be modified in-place (no new list creation allowed).
* Do not change the value of nodes, only the pointers.

---

####  Hints:

* Use two pointers, one for odd and one for even positions.
* Maintain the head of the even list to append at the end of the odd list.

###  Problem 1: **Rotate Linked List Clockwise by K Nodes**

#### Objective:

Given a singly linked list, rotate it **clockwise** by `K` nodes.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```
List = 10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 → 60,  K = 4
```

**Output:**

```
30 → 40 → 50 → 60 → 10 → 20
```

###  Problem 2: **Remove Duplicates from an Unsorted Linked List**

#### Objective:

Given an **unsorted** singly linked list, remove all duplicate elements so that each element appears only once.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```
List = 10 → 20 → 10 → 30 → 20 → 40
```

**Output:**

```
10 → 20 → 30 → 40
```

*Bonus*: Try solving without using extra space.

###  Problem 3: **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**

#### Objective:

Given two sorted singly linked lists, merge them to produce a single sorted linked list.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```
List1 = 10 → 30 → 50  
List2 = 20 → 40 → 60
```

**Output:**

```
10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 → 60
```

*Note:* Try both iterative and recursive approaches.

###  Problem 4: **Detect and Remove a Cycle in a Linked List**

#### Objective:

Given a linked list, detect if there’s a **cycle** (loop). If a cycle exists, **remove it** without losing any nodes.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 2 (Cycle back to node 2)
```

**Output:**

```
Cycle detected and removed
Final list: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
```

---

###  Problem 5: **Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists**

#### Objective:

Two non-empty linked lists represent two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```
List1 = 2 → 4 → 3 (342)
List2 = 5 → 6 → 4 (465)
```

**Output:**

```
7 → 0 → 8 (807)
```
