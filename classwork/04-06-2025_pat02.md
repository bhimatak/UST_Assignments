## Practice Problem Set – `std::set` (No Duplicates, Auto-Sorted)

---

### ✅ **Problem 1: Unique Visitor Tracker**

An online platform wants to track **unique users** visiting the site. User IDs are integers.

**Operations supported**:

* `VISIT user_id` → Add a user
* `UNIQUE` → Print number of unique visitors
* `TOP` → Print user IDs in ascending order

📝 **Input**:

```
VISIT 101
VISIT 105
VISIT 101
VISIT 110
UNIQUE
TOP
```

🟢 **Expected Output**:

```
3
101 105 110
```

---

### ✅ **Problem 2: Banned Words Filter**

Given a list of banned words, you need to filter them from an input paragraph.

Use `set<string>` to store banned words and check each word from the paragraph.

📝 **Input**:

```cpp
Banned: {"bad", "evil", "vulgar"}
Text: "this is a bad example with evil words"
```

🟢 **Output**:

```
Filtered: this is a example with words
```

### ✅ **Problem 3: Unique Stock Prices**

You're tracking real-time stock prices and want to:

* Store prices as they arrive
* Remove outdated price if needed
* Show the **lowest** and **highest** stock price at any moment

**Operations**:

* `ADD price`
* `REMOVE price`
* `MINMAX`

📝 **Input**:

```
ADD 310
ADD 305
ADD 320
REMOVE 305
MINMAX
```

🟢 **Expected Output**:

```
305 removed
310 320
```

---

### ✅ **Problem 4: Auto-Suggestions System**

Implement an autocomplete feature using a `set<string>`.

* Add keywords to dictionary.
* Given a prefix, return all matching words in **sorted** order.

📝 **Input**:

```cpp
Insert: apple, application, banana, apply, ball
Query: "app"
```

🟢 **Output**:

```
apple
application
apply
```

(Hint: use `lower_bound` and string prefix check)

---

### ✅ **Problem 5: Schedule Conflict Detection**

You are managing a calendar system. Given a list of booked time slots (integers in 24-hour format), check if a new time overlaps.

Use a `set<int>` to store booked hours and check if the new slot exists before booking.

📝 **Input**:

```cpp
BOOK 10
BOOK 14
BOOK 10  // duplicate
CHECK 11
BOOK 11
```

🟢 **Output**:

```
Booked: 10
Booked: 14
Already Booked
Free
Booked: 11
```

## 🧪 Sample Test Case – Problem 3: Stock Prices

**Input**:

```
ADD 120
ADD 125
ADD 115
ADD 130
REMOVE 115
MINMAX
```

**Expected Output**:

```
115 removed
120 130
```

## ✅ Methods You Can Use

* `insert(val)` – Insert unique value
* `erase(val)` – Remove value if it exists
* `find(val)` – Returns iterator to value
* `count(val)` – Check if element exists (`0` or `1`)
* `size()` – Number of elements
* `clear()` – Empty the set
* `lower_bound(val)` – Iterator to first element ≥ val
* `upper_bound(val)` – Iterator to first element > val
* `begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend()` – For traversal
* `empty()` – Check if set is empty
* `swap()` – Exchange with another set
