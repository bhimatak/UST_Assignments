## ⚙️ **Project: NetMon – Network Packet Monitoring Simulator with Alerting System**

### 🚀 **Assessment Problem Statement**

Develop a **menu-driven Network Packet Monitoring Simulator** that reads simulated packet traffic from a file, analyzes it based on protocol or packet size, and generates **alerts and logs** based on threshold breaches.

Implement a **logging system** with the following levels:

* `INFO` – routine packet monitoring messages
* `DEBUG` – detailed packet inspection info
* `WARNING` – packet with unusually high size
* `ERROR` – missing or malformed packet data

---

### ✅ **Core Features**

#### 1. Packet Definition

Each packet contains:

* Packet ID (unique)
* Protocol (`TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`)
* Packet Size (in bytes)

```cpp
class Packet {
    int packetID;
    std::string protocol;
    int size;
};
```

---

#### 2. File Handling

* Read packets from a file: `packets.txt`
* Write logs and alerts to: `netmon_log.txt`

---

#### 3. Analysis Options

Allow user to:

* Filter by protocol (`TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`)
* Detect large packets (>1000 bytes) and raise warnings

Use **function pointers** to switch between analysis modes dynamically.

---

#### 4. Alerting System

* Any packet > 1000 bytes triggers a `WARNING`
* Malformed lines trigger `ERROR`

---

#### 5. Logging System

```cpp
enum LogLevel { INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR };
void log(LogLevel level, const std::string& message);
```

---

### 📄 Sample Input File: `packets.txt`

```
1 TCP 450
2 UDP 980
3 ICMP 1050
4 TCP 200
5 FTP 300
```

---

### 💡 Sample CLI Interaction

```
==== NetMon Packet Monitor ====
1. Load packet data
2. Filter by protocol
3. Check for large packets
4. Export log
5. Exit
> 1
[INFO] Loaded 5 packets.

> 2 TCP
[DEBUG] Packet 1 | TCP | 450 bytes
[DEBUG] Packet 4 | TCP | 200 bytes

> 3
[WARNING] Packet 3 | ICMP | 1050 bytes

> 4
[INFO] Logs saved to netmon_log.txt.
```
