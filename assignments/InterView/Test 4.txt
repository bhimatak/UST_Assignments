Problem Statement 4:

Develop a function that counts the number of words in a given string. For this task, consider a word to be a sequence of letters and/or digits, which may optionally be followed by a comma, period, and/or spaces.

The goal is to identify such sequences and count how many valid words are present in the string. Multiple spaces or punctuation marks should not be treated as separate words.

Use the following function prototype:

int word_count(char* string);
Note:
Words are case-insensitive.
Non-alphanumeric characters (except , and .) are considered delimiters.
Assume the input string is null-terminated.
