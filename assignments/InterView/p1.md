## **Problem Set**

---

### **1. Basics of C++, Loops, Control Statements**

**Problem 1:**
Write a C++ program to generate a *number pyramid* for a given positive integer `N`. If `N=5`, the output should be:

```
1  
2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9 10  
11 12 13 14 15
```

Use only loops and conditional control statements.

---

### **2. C++ Loops, Control Statements, Functions**

**Problem 2:**
Create a C++ program with a function that determines if a given number is *Harshad (Niven) Number*. A Harshad Number is divisible by the sum of its digits. The main program should read `N` numbers and display which ones are Harshad.

---

### **3. Basics of C++, Loops, Control Statements, Functions, Structures**

**Problem 3:**
Design a structure `Book` with members `title`, `author`, `price`. Write functions to:

* Accept data for 5 books.
* Display all books costing more than 500.
* Find and display the book with the highest price.

---

### **4. Structures, Class, Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Constructors, Destructors, Message Passing, Data Structures**

**Problem 4:**
Create a class `BankAccount` with private members: `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, and `balance`.

* Use constructor, destructor, getter/setter methods.
* Implement methods for `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `displayBalance()`.
* Create an array of 3 objects and perform transactions on them.

---

**Problem 5:**
Design two classes:

1. `Rectangle` — with length and breadth as private members.
2. `Cuboid` — derived from `Rectangle` (inheritance) with height as an additional member.

Apply **abstraction** and **encapsulation**. Show message passing via friend function to calculate and display the volume of Cuboid.

---

### **5. Advanced topics of C++ like STL, C++11/14/17 features, Iterators**

**Problem 6:**
Write a C++ program to read a list of integers from the user and store them in a `std::vector`.

* Use an iterator to remove all prime numbers.
* Display the updated vector using range-based `for` loop (C++11 feature).

---

**Problem 7:**
Create a `std::map<string, int>` representing students and their marks.

* Use `auto` (C++11) and structured bindings (C++17) to traverse the map.
* Find and display the student(s) with the highest mark.

---

### **6. Advanced features of C++ 11/14/17 and Multithreading**

**Problem 8:**
Design a multithreaded C++ program where:

* Thread 1 prints *even numbers* from 0 to 20.
* Thread 2 prints *odd numbers* from 1 to 19.
  Ensure the outputs are **strictly in order**: even, odd, even, odd…

(Synchronize using `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`, avoid `unique_lock` if not preferred).

---

**Problem 9:**
Implement a *thread pool* using **std::thread** and a simple task queue (`std::queue`).

* The main thread assigns 5 "print message" tasks to the queue.
* Two worker threads pull tasks and process them.

Use **C++14 lambda alternatives** or separate callable classes to avoid lambdas as per your preference.

---

**Problem 10:**
Using **variadic templates (C++11)**, create a generic logger function:

```cpp
log("Error at line", 42, ":", "Invalid pointer detected");
```

This should output:

```
Error at line 42 : Invalid pointer detected
```
