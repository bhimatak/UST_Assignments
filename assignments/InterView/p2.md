## **C++ Practical Problem Statements for Interview Readiness (Applied Materials aligned)**

---

### **1. Object-Oriented Thinking & Design**

**Problem 1:**
Design a C++ class `Sensor` that represents an equipment sensor in a manufacturing plant.

* Attributes: `sensorID`, `sensorType`, `readingValue`.
* Use proper encapsulation.
* Add methods to **update the reading** and **display sensor details**.
* Inherit a class `TemperatureSensor` that adds a `unit` (Celsius/Fahrenheit) and method to convert between them.

📝 *Interview Angle*: Object-oriented thinking, Encapsulation, Inheritance.

---

### **2. Data Structures + Problem Solving**

**Problem 2:**
A wafer production line logs defect counts per batch in a file. Each line in the file contains:

```
<BatchID> <DefectCount>
```

Write a program to:

* Read the file.
* Store records in a `std::map<std::string, int>`.
* Display the top 3 batches with the highest defects.

📝 *Interview Angle*: File I/O, STL Map, Sorting by value, Practical data handling.

---

### **3. Debugging Logic (Loops + Conditions)**

**Problem 3:**
A process step should execute exactly N times, but your loop runs infinite. Debug and fix:

```cpp
int n = 5;
for(int i=1; i!=n; i+=2) {  // Logical issue here
   cout << "Step " << i << endl;
}
```

Write the correct loop and explain why the original code failed.

📝 *Interview Angle*: Debugging, Loop correctness — favorite for client "what’s wrong here?" questions.

---

### **4. Operator Overloading**

**Problem 4:**
Model a `Time` class with hours and minutes.

* Overload `+` to add two `Time` objects properly handling minute overflow.
* Example: (2hr 50min) + (1hr 30min) = (4hr 20min)

📝 *Interview Angle*: Operator Overloading — they check this often to assess C++ fluency.

---

### **5. Memory Management — Pointers & Classes**

**Problem 5:**
Create a `Process` class with dynamically allocated char array for process name.

* Implement **Rule of Three**: Constructor, Copy Constructor, Destructor.
* Avoid memory leaks.

📝 *Interview Angle*: Heap allocation, deep copy, memory safety — critical in embedded/system software.

---

### **6. C++11/14/17 Features**

**Problem 6:**
Store process events in a `std::tuple<std::string, int, double>`: (ProcessName, ProcessID, Duration).

* Use `std::vector` of tuples.
* Print all process names and durations using **structured bindings** (C++17).

📝 *Interview Angle*: Modern C++, Tuple handling, Structured bindings.

---

### **7. STL Algorithm Mastery**

**Problem 7:**
You have a list of temperature readings:
`{35.5, 36.0, 34.8, 36.5, 33.7}`
Write a program using STL to:

* Remove all readings below 35 using `remove_if` and functor (no lambda).
* Display remaining values.

📝 *Interview Angle*: STL algorithms, Functors — they love to check this.

---

### **8. String Manipulation (Practical C++)**

**Problem 8:**
A log file has entries like:

```
[INFO] Process started  
[ERROR] Sensor failure  
[WARNING] Low memory  
```

Extract and count the number of occurrences of each log level using `std::map<string, int>`.

📝 *Interview Angle*: Real-world string parsing, Map usage — asked in tool logs & diagnostic automation.

---

### **9. Templates & Type Safety**

**Problem 9:**
Implement a **templated Min function** that returns the smallest of three values of any type.
Example: `minVal(3, 5, 2)` or `minVal(3.2, 1.5, 4.8)`.

📝 *Interview Angle*: Templates, Generic programming — clients check this for flexibility.

---

### **10. Class Relationship (Association/Aggregation)**

**Problem 10:**
Design a `Machine` class which has a `Sensor` object (as a member) — showing aggregation.

* Initialize both in constructors.
* Display details of both machine and sensor.

📝 *Interview Angle*: Object relationships (HAS-A), Constructor initialization — practical in system modeling.
