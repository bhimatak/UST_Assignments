Problem Statement 1:

Design a function that processes a given string where words may be separated by one or more whitespace characters (such as spaces, tabs, etc.). The function should compact all sequences of consecutive whitespace into a single space between words. Additionally, it must ensure that the final string has no leading or trailing spaces.

As a challenge, try implementing this functionality without creating any temporary string buffers or allocating extra memory.

The function should be declared as follows:

void normalize_sentence(char *str);
