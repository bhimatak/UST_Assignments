### **1. Basics of C++, Loops, Control Statements**

**Problem 1:**
Write a C++ program that prints all **Armstrong numbers** between 100 and 999.
(An Armstrong number is a number such that the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself. Example: 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³)

### **2. C++ Loops, Control Statements, Functions**

**Problem 2:**
Create a C++ program that accepts a string and checks whether it is a **palindrome** or not using functions.

* Ignore spaces and case sensitivity.

---

### **3. Basics of C++, Loops, Control Statements, Functions, Structures**

**Problem 3:**
Define a structure `Employee` containing `ID`, `Name`, `Department`, and `Salary`.
Write a program to:

* Accept details of 5 employees.
* Display names of employees whose salary is above the average salary of all 5.

---

### **4. Structures, Class, Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Constructors, Destructors, Data Structures**

**Problem 4:**
Design a class `Distance` having private members: feet and inches.

* Overload the `+` operator to add two distance objects.
* Use constructors and a destructor.
* Display the result in feet and inches format.

---

**Problem 5:**
Create two classes `Circle` and `Cylinder`.

* `Circle` should have members `radius`, and function to compute area.
* `Cylinder` should inherit from `Circle` and compute the volume.
* Demonstrate **constructor chaining** and function overriding.

---

### **5. Advanced topics of C++ like STL, C++11/14/17 features, Iterators**

**Problem 6:**
Write a C++ program that reads a list of integers into a `std::list`.

* Remove all duplicate elements using **STL algorithms** (`unique`, `sort`).
* Display the list after duplicates are removed.
* Use `auto` keyword and range-based for loops (C++11).

---

**Problem 7:**
Maintain a **phonebook** using `std::map<std::string, std::string>`.

* Store names and their corresponding phone numbers.
* Allow the user to query by name.
* Display "Contact not found" if the name is missing.
* Use **structured bindings** (C++17) while iterating over the map.

---

**Problem 8:**
Create a C++ program to:

* Read `N` numbers into a `std::vector`.
* Remove all numbers divisible by 3 using the **`remove_if` algorithm and functor (no lambdas)**.
* Display the final list using iterators.

---

### **6. C++11/14/17 Features**

**Problem 9:**
Design a **generic swap function** using **templates** to swap two variables of any type (int, double, string).
Demonstrate:

* **`decltype` and `auto` (C++11)** in your implementation.
* Call the function for three different types.

---

**Problem 10:**
Create a **`std::tuple` based container** to store details of a car:

* (Car Name, Year of Manufacture, Price).
* Display details of all cars stored in a vector of tuples.
* Use `std::get<>` and **structured bindings (C++17)**.
