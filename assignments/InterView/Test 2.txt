20 mins
Problem Statement 2:

You're given the exam results of 20 students, each evaluated in 5 subjects. The marks are stored in a flat integer array of size 100, where the marks for each student are grouped together in sequence â€” 5 marks per student, student after student.

A student is deemed to have passed if:

They score 40 or more in each of the 5 subjects, and
Their total score across all subjects is at least 250.
Write a function that scans the array and returns the count of students who meet both criteria.

Function signature:

int count_passed_students(int marks[100]);
