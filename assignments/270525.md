### ✅ **Problem 1: Academic Result Management**

**Concepts:** Class, Single Inheritance, Constructor, Method Overloading

**Problem Statement:**
Create a class `Student` with data members `rollNo`, `name`, and `age`. Create a derived class `Marks` that inherits from `Student` and contains marks of three subjects. Use constructor initialization for all attributes. Implement a method `calculate()` to compute total and average marks. Overload the `display()` function to:

* Display only student data (rollNo, name, age)
* Display full result (including total and average)

**Input:**

```
Enter Roll No: 101
Enter Name: Alice
Enter Age: 20
Enter Marks: 89 76 91
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Student Info:
Roll No: 101
Name: Alice
Age: 20

Full Result:
Total Marks: 256
Average Marks: 85.33
```

### ✅ **Problem 2: Employee Salary Calculation with Multiple Roles**

**Concepts:** Class, Multiple Inheritance, Constructor, Method Overloading

**Problem Statement:**
Create a class `Employee` with basic details (`empId`, `name`). Create two base classes `Developer` and `Manager` which inherit `Employee` and contain role-specific data (coding hours and team size respectively). Derive a class `TechLead` from both `Developer` and `Manager`. Use constructors to initialize data. Overload a function `calculateSalary()` to:

* Calculate salary based on only coding hours
* Calculate salary based on coding hours + team size

**Input:**

```
EmpId: 501
Name: Rajesh
Coding Hours: 120
Team Size: 5
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Tech Lead Info:
EmpId: 501
Name: Rajesh

Salary based on coding: ₹60000
Salary based on coding + team: ₹85000
```

*Assume ₹500/hour and ₹5000/team member*

### ✅ **Problem 3: Vehicle Rental System**

**Concepts:** Class, Single Inheritance, Constructor, Method Overloading

**Problem Statement:**
Design a base class `Vehicle` with attributes `vehicleId`, `type`, and `ratePerKm`. Derive two classes `Car` and `Bike` from it. Use constructors to initialize values. Overload a method `calculateFare()` to:

* Accept only distance
* Accept distance and number of days (for long-term rental with discount)

**Input:**

```
Vehicle Type: Car
Vehicle ID: C100
Rate: 15
Distance: 100
Days: 3
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Fare without discount: ₹1500
Fare with long-term discount: ₹1350
```

*Assume 10% discount for rentals > 2 days*
