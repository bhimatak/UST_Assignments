### âœ… **Problem Statement: Employee Record Management using Linked List**

Design a system in **C++** to manage a list of employees using a **singly linked list**. Each `Employee` has the following details:

* `int id`: Unique identifier
* `string name`: Employee name
* `float salary`: Monthly salary

You are required to implement the following operations:

1. **Add Employee** â€“ Add a new employee to the end of the list.
2. **Display All Employees** â€“ Show details of all employees.
3. **Delete Employee by ID** â€“ Remove an employee by their ID.
4. **Search Employee by Name** â€“ Return all employees whose names match a given name (case-sensitive).
5. **Update Salary by ID** â€“ Update the salary of an employee using their ID.
6. **Count Total Employees** â€“ Return the count of employees in the list.

### ðŸ”§ Constraints

* IDs are unique integers.
* Name is a non-empty string with at most 50 characters.
* Salary is a positive float.
* Maximum number of employees: 1000

---

### ðŸ§± Class and Structure Requirements

* Define an `Employee` class.
* Create a linked list where each node contains an `Employee` object.
* Avoid using STL containers like `vector` or `list`.

### ðŸ“¥ Input Format (For Testing)

Use a **menu-based interface**:

```
1. Add Employee
2. Display All Employees
3. Delete Employee by ID
4. Search Employee by Name
5. Update Salary by ID
6. Count Employees
0. Exit
```
