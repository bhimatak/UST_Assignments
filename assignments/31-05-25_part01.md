## ‚öôÔ∏è **Project: JobChain ‚Äì CPU Job Scheduling Simulator with Logging System**

### üöÄ **Assessment Problem Statement**

Build a **menu-driven CPU Job Scheduling Simulator** that loads a list of jobs from a file and executes them according to selected scheduling strategies such as FIFO (by Job ID) or Priority-based scheduling.

You must implement a **basic logging mechanism** that supports **log levels**:

* `INFO` ‚Äì routine execution info
* `DEBUG` ‚Äì internal computations like sort order
* `WARNING` ‚Äì non-critical anomalies
* `ERROR` ‚Äì critical issues (e.g., failed file reads)

---

### ‚úÖ **Core Features**

#### 1. Job Definition

Each job contains:

* Job ID (unique)
* Execution Time (in milliseconds)
* Priority (1 to 5; 5 = highest)

```cpp
class Job {
    int jobID;
    int executionTime;
    int priority;
};
```

---

#### 2. File Handling

* Read job data from a text file: `jobs.txt`
* Write execution logs to a text file: `job_log.txt`

---

#### 3. Scheduling Algorithms

Allow users to choose between:

* FIFO (by Job ID)
* Priority-Based (higher priority first)

Use a **function pointer** to switch between strategies dynamically.

---

#### 4. Simulated Execution

* Use `std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds)` to simulate each job's execution time.
* Track and display **total time taken**.

---

#### 5. Logging System

Implement a basic logger class supporting levels:

```cpp
enum LogLevel { INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR };
void log(LogLevel level, const std::string& message);
```

Sample usage:

```cpp
log(INFO, "Loaded 5 jobs from file.");
log(DEBUG, "Sorted jobs based on priority.");
log(ERROR, "File could not be opened.");
```

---

### üìÑ Sample Input File: `jobs.txt`

```
1 100 2
2 150 3
3 120 1
4 180 5
5 130 4
```

Each line: `<JobID> <ExecutionTime> <Priority>`

---

### üí° Sample CLI Interaction

```
==== JobChain Scheduler ====
1. Load jobs from file
2. Choose scheduling algorithm
   a. FIFO (Job ID)
   b. Priority-based
3. Execute jobs
4. Export log
5. Exit
> 1
[INFO] Successfully loaded 5 jobs.

> 2b
[INFO] Selected Priority Scheduling.

> 3
[DEBUG] Executing Job ID: 4 | Priority: 5
[DEBUG] Executing Job ID: 5 | Priority: 4
...
[INFO] All jobs executed in 680ms.

> 4
[INFO] Log saved to job_log.txt.
```

---

### üìÑ Sample Output Log: `job_log.txt`

```
[INFO] JobChain Execution Log
----------------------------------------
[DEBUG] Sorting jobs by priority...
[DEBUG] Job 4 | Priority 5 | ExecTime 180ms
[DEBUG] Job 5 | Priority 4 | ExecTime 130ms
[DEBUG] Job 2 | Priority 3 | ExecTime 150ms
[DEBUG] Job 1 | Priority 2 | ExecTime 100ms
[DEBUG] Job 3 | Priority 1 | ExecTime 120ms
[INFO] All jobs completed successfully.
[INFO] Total simulated time: 680ms
```
