### **Assignment: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation with Project Management Using Jira**

#### **Problem Statement**

Implement a complete **CI/CD pipeline** for a **simple calculator application** developed using **Visual Studio 2022**, and manage the entire project using **Jira** for task tracking and agile project management. This assignment is aimed at providing hands-on experience with **end-to-end DevOps practices** using **GitHub Actions** and integrating **agile methodologies** into the development lifecycle.

#### **Objectives:**

1. **Develop a Calculator Application**

   * Implement a simple calculator with basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using C++ in Visual Studio 2022.
   * Follow proper coding standards and modular structure with separate files for source code, headers, and test cases.

2. **Set Up Source Code Management (SCM)**

   * Create and maintain a **GitHub repository** for the project.
   * Ensure the repository has a clean commit history and follows best practices (e.g., meaningful commit messages, use of branches for features or fixes).

3. **Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

   * Set up a GitHub Actions workflow (`.yml`) to:

     * Automatically build the application on each push or pull request.
     * Run **unit tests** using a suitable testing framework (e.g., GoogleTest or Catch2).
     * Provide real-time feedback on build and test status within GitHub.

4. **Project Management with Jira**

   * Use **Jira** to:

     * Define user stories, tasks, and subtasks for the development of the calculator application.
     * Organize work using **Scrum or Kanban boards**.
     * Track progress across **sprints**, assign tasks, and manage priorities.
     * Document project goals, workflows, and issue resolutions.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**

   * Prepare a `README.md` file explaining:

     * Project overview
     * Setup and build instructions
     * Testing strategy
     * CI/CD workflow
   * Export a report or screenshot of the Jira board showing task tracking, sprint planning, and progress.

#### **Deliverables:**

* GitHub repository link with:

  * Source code
  * Unit tests
  * CI/CD configuration (`.yml` file)
  * README documentation
* Jira board screenshot or export (in PDF or image format)
* Summary of sprint/iteration planning (if applicable)

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**

* Functional completeness of the calculator application
* Correctness and automation of CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions
* Test coverage and quality of unit tests
* Effective use of Jira for task tracking and agile project management
* Code quality, structure, and documentation clarity
