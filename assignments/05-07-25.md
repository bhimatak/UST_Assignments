### **Assignment: Implement CI/CD Pipeline for a Calculator Application**

#### **Problem Statement**

Design and implement a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline for a **simple calculator application** developed using **Visual Studio 2022**. The project must be version-controlled using **GitHub**, and the CI/CD workflow should be configured using **GitHub Actions**.

#### **Objectives:**

1. **Develop** a basic calculator application (supporting operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using C++ in Visual Studio 2022.
2. **Set up GitHub repository** to host the project source code.
3. **Configure GitHub Actions** to:

   * Automatically build the application on code push or pull request.
   * Run **unit tests** to validate the correctness of calculator functions.
   * Provide status feedback (build success/failure, test results) within the repository.
4. **Ensure proper project structure** for maintainability and scalability, including separate folders for source code, headers, and test files.

#### **Deliverables:**

* Source code of the calculator application.
* Unit test implementation using a suitable testing framework (e.g., GoogleTest or Catch2).
* `.yml` configuration file for GitHub Actions defining the CI/CD workflow.
* Documentation (README) describing the project setup, testing procedure, and CI/CD pipeline.

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**

* Correctness and completeness of calculator functionality.
* Proper implementation and automation of CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
* Quality and coverage of unit tests.
* Clean and organized project structure.
* Clear documentation and code readability.
