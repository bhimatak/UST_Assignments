## ✅ **Problem 2: Digits Frequency Counter**
Objective: Write a program to count the frequency of each digit (0–9) in a given integer.  
Note:
- do not use arrays.  
Example:  
Input: 34534453  
Output:  
Digit frequencies:  
0: 0  
1: 0  
2: 0  
3: 3  
4: 3
5: 0
6: 0
7: 0
8: 0
9: 0
0: 0  


## ✅ **Problem 3: Check for Armstrong Number**
Objective: Write a program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number.  
Requirements:  
- Use a loop to calculate the sum of cubes of the digits of the number.  
- Compare the sum with the original number to determine if it's an Armstrong number.  
Example:  
Input: 153  
Output: Armstrong number 
explanation: 
(since (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153))
